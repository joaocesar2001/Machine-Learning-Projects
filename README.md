# Machine-Learning-Projects



This repository was created to host my Machine Learning projects developed for my undergraduate physics course.
The models are primarily applied to problems in *High Energy Physics*.

### MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron):
[MLP_from_scratch](https://github.com/joaocesar2001/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/MLP/MLP_from_scratch.pynb.ipynb) - An Artificial Neural Network implemented from scratch using Python classes in a Jupyter Notebook.
